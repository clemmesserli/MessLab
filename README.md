# MessLabs
This repo is intended to help newcomers harness the power of [AutomatedLab] (<https://github.com/AutomatedLab/AutomatedLab>). **AutomatedLab** (AL) enables you to create your own lab environments on either Hyper-V or Azure. Below is a list of basic requirements and within this repo, you will find scripts and add-on files that will provide real-world user scenarios to help you help yourself.

## Requirements
- AutomatedLab Module which I recommend installing via PowerShell Core
- Hyper-V Host machine or an Azure Subscription
- ISO Image files (trial versions work just fine)
- Local Admin privileges are required
- At least 6 GB of RAM on your host machine
- Enough drive space to store the virtual machine images
