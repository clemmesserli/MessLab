# MessLab
This repo is dependent upon [AutomatedLab] (<https://github.com/AutomatedLab/AutomatedLab>). **AutomatedLab** (AL) enables you to create your own lab environments on either Hyper-V or Azure. Below is a list of basic requirements and within this repo, you will find my own customized Hyper-V home labs.

## Requirements
- AutomatedLab Module which I recommend installing via PowerShell Core
- Hyper-V Host machine
- ISO Image files (trial versions work just fine)
- Local Admin privileges are required
- At least 6 GB of RAM on your host machine
- Enough drive space to store the virtual machine images
